## Problem

Given an array of boxes _B_ where each box has three dimensions _H_, _W_, _L_,
We want to stack the boxes on top of each other such that the height _H_ is maximized

Boxes cannot be rotated and each dimension is an integer

Furthermore, for a Box to be on top of another box, it's respective dimensions must all
be less than the box under it
