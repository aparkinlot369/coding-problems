# A Light Introduction to DP

## Application

In essence, it's to avoid repeared calculation
- Through Recursion, this is whatnot the more _natural_ approach
  - a larger problem is broken up into smaller subproblems
  - upon the first time seeing/coming across this subproblem, _memoize_ it
- Also known as Top-Down DP

- Or Through starting with smaller subproblems, and solving larger ones based on them
  - start at the base cases (of the recurrence)
- Also known as Bottom-Up DP

## List of Problems

- Ladders
- Minimum Jumps
- Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
- Box Stacking
