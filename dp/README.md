# A Review, A Study-List, and some Challenging Problems on Dynamic Programming (DP)

The purpose of this repository is to house:
 1. A Light Review/Introduction to DP -> `intro`
 2. Some Modern/Interview Problems That Exist/Common -> `modern`
 3. Some Challenging Problems -> `comp`

These three different directories contain problems, explanations, and analysis.

## Further Details

For each problem outside of the `intro` directory, there will most likely be links to each specific problem.
Specifically, problems in `modern` and most definitely in `comp` will have additional notes for aid.

Each directory will contain their own list of problems which may have added details overtime.
